"""Faithful Tier-B fault-injection regression for the #1026 turn-context desync.

Issue #1026 wedges a session **permanently** through a three-factor race:

1. An active turn has a tool dispatch IN FLIGHT (a parked dispatch future).
2. The harness/upstream connection drops on the policy-verdict-delivery POST —
   ``httpx.RemoteProtocolError: Server disconnected without sending a response``
   raised inside :func:`_evaluate_policy_via_omnigent` at the
   ``harness_client.post(...)`` callsite (``omnigent/runner/app.py``).
3. A NEW user message is buffered into the already-active turn (the
   ``post_session_events`` "buffering message for active turn" branch) racing
   with #2.

On the **pre-fix** code the active-turn binding was cleared but never rebound,
so every later inner-SDK callback orphaned, and the policy gate fell back to a
silent fail-OPEN (``ALLOW``) on the authoritative ``PHASE_TOOL_CALL`` gate. The
session then stayed wedged until a host-daemon restart.

PR #1077 fixes this with (a) a fail-CLOSED policy verdict for ``PHASE_TOOL_CALL``
when no turn context is bound, (b) a Tier-1 per-conversation SDK self-heal
(:meth:`ExecutorAdapter._maybe_resync_on_orphan`) once N consecutive orphans
accumulate, and (c) a runner-side verdict-delivery retry-then-signal that drives
``_resync_turn_state`` to publish a single ``runner_turn_context_desync``
terminal status (or hand off to a buffered continuation).

This module proves BOTH directions of the faithfulness gate, and — per
cross-review — does so **without manufacturing the symptom**:

* The negative control flips the fix OFF with the SMALLEST REAL toggles the
  production code reads — ``FAIL_CLOSED_PHASES`` (the constant the real policy
  evaluator consults) set to ``()`` and ``_ORPHAN_RESYNC_THRESHOLD`` set out of
  reach — and then exercises the REAL ``_stable_policy_evaluator`` /
  ``_stable_tool_executor`` / ``_maybe_resync_on_orphan``. The fail-OPEN +
  unbounded-orphan symptom therefore comes OUT OF production code; nothing is
  hand-rolled. With the constants at their real values the SAME real calls fail
  CLOSED and self-heal — that contrast is the proof.

* The headline test chains all three factors into ONE causal scenario:
  - factor #1 — a REAL in-flight harness turn started through the production
    scaffold entry (``_start_or_inject_turn``, which registers ``_in_flight`` /
    ``_active_turn_ctx``) whose executor parks a REAL tool dispatch through the
    production ``_stable_tool_executor`` → ``_bridge_one_dispatch`` →
    ``dispatch_tool`` path (no hand-inserted future);
  - factor #2 — the REAL verdict-POST drop firing the REAL retry-then-signal
    into the REAL ``_resync_turn_state``;
  - factor #3 — a REAL buffered message via the REAL ``post_session_events``
    route.
  The orphan callbacks then fire because the REAL harness turn teardown
  (``_stream_turn`` finally → ``_teardown_turn`` → ``run_turn`` finally, unwound
  by the REAL interrupt forward) cleared the context — NOT because a test poked
  ``_current_ctx = None``. Recovery is proved by a SUBSEQUENT REAL harness turn
  that rebinds a live ctx and dispatches a tool to a terminal ``TurnComplete``.

The full cross-process harness↔runner socket cannot be scripted deterministically
in one process (``omnigent/runner/app.py`` says as much where it exposes
``app.state.resync_turn_state`` as a test seam). This test stands in for that one
socket hop — the runner's interrupt forward closes the harness stream (cancels
the task draining the real ``_start_or_inject_turn`` StreamingResponse) — and
otherwise drives only real code at each callsite.

HONEST BOUNDARY (Tier-A): one thing is intentionally NOT asserted here — that the
RUNNER itself drives the buffered continuation to a terminal outcome (drain the
buffer → start a continuation turn → ``proxy_stream`` it to the harness → consume
its SSE → terminalize). That round-trip is the runner→harness streaming-dispatch
path, which the project exercises only via a REAL harness subprocess over a UDS
(see ``tests/runner/test_runner_dispatch.py`` /
``tests/runner/test_app_sessions_native.py``, which spawn real uvicorn harness
subprocesses). Reproducing it deterministically in-process would require a full
Tier-A integration harness (runner app + harness app + a StreamingResponse↔httpx
streaming-transport bridge + spec/MCP/content-resolution setup + multi-background-
task polling) — not a Tier-B unit test. Rather than re-stage it with fakes, this
module asserts the deterministic REAL recovery facts (the resync hands off to the
P1.7 continuation path, and a real recovered harness turn dispatches to terminal)
and leaves the runner-internal buffer→continuation→terminal stream to a Tier-A
integration test. The no-buffer runner recovery (``_resync_turn_state`` publishing
exactly one ``runner_turn_context_desync`` terminal status) IS proved here, since
that path needs no harness stream.
